This project focuses on analyzing business performance data and transforming raw datasets into meaningful insights using Advanced MS Excel. The objective is to support data-driven decision-making by tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizing trends through an interactive dashboard.

The project involves data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and performance gaps. Key metrics are analyzed across different dimensions such as time, category, and region to provide a comprehensive performance overview.

An interactive Excel dashboard is built using Pivot Tables, charts, and advanced formulas (VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, IF, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS), enabling users to dynamically filter data and monitor business KPIs efficiently. The solution improves reporting efficiency and presents insights in a clear, business-friendly format suitable for stakeholders.
